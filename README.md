# Connect-Four
Connect Four is a two player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, positive diagonal and negative diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
