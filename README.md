##  :beginner: About
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

##  :exclamation: Guideline

- __Code Style__

### `black`
In order to maintain the code style consistency across entire project I use a code formatter. I kindly suggest you to do the same whenever you push commits to this project. 

The python code formatter I chose is called Black. It is a great tool and it can be installed quickly by running 

```bash
sudo -H pip3 install black
```

or

```bash
python3.6 -m pip install black
```

It requires Python 3.6.0+ to run.

- __Usage__

```bash
black {source_file_or_directory}
```

For more details and available options, please check their [psf/black](https://github.com/psf/black).

### `isort`
I also use isort, it is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically, and automatically separated into sections. It provides a command line utility which can be installed using.

```bash
sudo -H pip3 install isort 
```

- __Usage__

```bash
isort {source_file}.py
```

For more details and available options, please check their [timothycrosley/isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort).
